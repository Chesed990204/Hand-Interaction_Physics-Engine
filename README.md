# Hand-Interaction_Physics-Engine

### This project addresses physics simulation, rendering simple hand model in virtual space. 
### You can interact with virtual balls using your hand through webcam, which is composed of virtual balls too.

1. You can modify number of balls with variable: BALLS
2. You can modify size of balls with variable: MIN_BALL_SIZE & MAX_BALL_SIZE
